# A collection of docker images for data scientists

Docker images and recipes with additional packages and extensions for on-the-go data scientists. With examples of using some cool software.

## Jupyter based images
See [Jupyter docker-stacks]

* `pynb` - Python Jupyter Notebook: An image with some of my favorite packages in Python (that aren't part of the Jupyter Docker stack).
* 'deeplearning`: An image with some common deep learning packages such as tensorflow, pytorch, keras, etc.
* `biogeme`: [Biogeme] is an open source Python package for Econometric Modeling.

## Rocker based images
See [Rocker versioned] and [Rocker geospatial]

* `rstudio` - An image with some of my favorite packages in R (that aren't part of the Rocker Docker stack): [Cancensus] is a R wrapper for calling CensusMapper APIs.

## Other cool stuff

* `mssql` - SQL Server: See [SQL Server for Docker]
* `portainer`: See [Portainer]
* `gogs`: See [Gogs for Docker]
* `gitLab`: See [GitLab Community Edition for Docker]
* `pishrink`: A tool from [Drewsif/PiShrink] that shrinks the size of a raspbian image for raspberry pi
